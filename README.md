Tic Tac Toe :

The Tic Tac Toe Game project is a web-based implementation of the classic 3x3 grid game, developed using Java and JSP (Java Server Pages). This project demonstrates the application of object-oriented programming principles, session management, and dynamic web development. The game allows two players to alternate turns, selecting cells on the grid until one player wins or the game ends in a draw. The system effectively manages the game state using Java session attributes, ensuring smooth interaction between the frontend and backend.
Purpose of the Project :

The purpose of this project is to develop a fully functional and interactive Tic Tac Toe game that demonstrates the use of Java Servlet Pages (JSP), Java classes, and web-based design techniques. It serves as a practical implementation of Java-based web technologies for game development.

Key Features :


1.  Interactive Gameplay:
•	Allows two players to take turns and compete in a classic 3x3 grid Tic Tac Toe game.
•	The interface updates dynamically after each player's move.
2.  Session Management:
•	Utilizes Java session objects to maintain the state of the game during player interactions.
3.  Game Logic Implementation:
•	Features comprehensive game logic to detect valid moves, determine the winner, or identify a draw.
4.  Responsive UI:
•	Uses CSS for a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.
5.  Restart Option:
•	Players can reset the game anytime to start fresh.
6.  Move Validation:
•	Prevents players from making invalid moves, such as selecting an already occupied cell.
 
Technology Stack :


1.  Backend:
•	Java (for game logic and session handling).
•	JSP (Java Server Pages for dynamic web content generation).
2.  Frontend:
•	HTML and CSS (for UI design and layout).
3.  Web Server:
•	Apache Tomcat.
4.  Development Tools:
•	Eclipse IDE.

Expected Outcome :

1.	Initial Display:
o	A 3x3 grid with buttons representing empty cells for players to make their moves.
2.	Gameplay:
o	Players alternate turns until a win or draw condition is met.
o	The UI dynamically updates with the players' moves.
3.	Win/Draw Notifications:
o	Displays a message announcing the winner or indicating a draw.
4.	Game Reset:
o	Players can restart the game by clicking the Reset button.
